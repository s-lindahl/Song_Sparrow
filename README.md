# Song_Sparrow
Song Sparrow Song Frequency Study for Senior Project. Statisitical analysis performed in R

This project was completed independently in May of 2022 while I was in my senior year at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt

The R script performs a spearman rank correlation test and plots the data onto a graph that follows the Journal of Wildlife Management publication guidelines. The python script was created to generate a map of the dectected song sparrow locations between the two study areas. Please download the CSVs and adjust your pathing to read the CSVs in R as needed. If you'd like to use the map generator for your own project you will need to modify the code to suit your needs. I have also included my research poster if you'd like to take a look at it. Enjoy!

# ABSTRACT

Bird song, specifically amongst passerine songbirds, has been of great interest to biologists and the public. Many biologists are concerned about the effects of anthropogenic noise on bird song in relation to breeding success, mate attraction, and territorial defense in avian species. Previous studies have shown that many species have plasticity in song when presented with common low frequency anthropogenic noise. Our study looked at the low frequency vocal plasticity in the songs of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) in loud natural environments compared to quiet environments. While anthropogenic noise is of great concern to many species when thinking about conservation and management approaches, our results suggest that passerine songbirds may be better adapted to mitigate the effects of low frequency sound from an evolutionary standpoint. We found evidence that Song Sparrow songs had significantly higher minimum frequencies in ocean bluff environments when compared to quiet environments. These evolutionary adaptations in vocal plasticity and large vocabularies may have originally developed in response to sounds of rivers, wind, and ocean surf. The impact of natural sound on passerine songbirdsâ€™ overall fitness is still not well understood and is a topic for future research. There are likely additional environmental factors causing songbirds to avoid noisy habitats that need to be further studied and considered for conservation and management plans.
